# LightFeatherAssignment
Takehome Assignment for Lightfeather

- After downloading files to your computer, find and open LightFeatherAssignment folder. There should be a client folder, and a Readme.md, which is this file

- Right click on the client folder and select open in comand prompt/windows terminal/git bash which ever command line interface you use

Alternatively, open your command line interface and change the working directory to the client folder  (ex.....LightFeatherAssignment\client>)

- One you are in the client directory, type npm install and press enter

This command will install all dependecies needed from the package.json file in the client folder to allow the app to run

- After the installation is complete (kinda long, 2-5mins), in that same directory, type npm start and press enter

This command will use port 3000 and open up the app in your default browser.

- In the CLI window, to the right of the word Local, there is a http link to the local host that is hosting the app, this link can be copied and entered into any web browser you desire

- Once the app is running on a browser, the app is now usable =)

- To stop app, go back to your CLI window and type shift+c, then press enter
